## WEB550 - File Storage

This flag was likely related to the route https://71fb1303c76a0ab6cc6890256c1e743e.challenge.hackazon.org/dav/. While the route itself is forbidden, there is likely a file somewhere inside the dav folder containing or leading to the flag which is not forbidden.

Upon googling, we found that dav could refer to the technology called WebDAV: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV but we did not get any further than this.
