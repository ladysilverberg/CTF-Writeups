## WEB550 - Sitemap

Web start by visiting the route /robots.txt to look if there's any interesting routes there. There is one interesting route there, which by visiting leads us to download a Gunzip archive containing a file called sitemap.xml. Investigating this file shows us not only different routes used in later parts of the WEB550 leg, but also contains a flag which solves this challenge.
