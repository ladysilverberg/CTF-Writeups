# Deloitte CTF - Norwegian Qualifiers 2021
Writeups for the tasks our team solved.
The CTF lasted for 3 hours.

**These writeups lacks some images, flags and detail. This is due to the fact that the tasks were only accessible for the 3 hours the CTF lasted, so everything we didn't store on our computers locally got lost.**
**As a result, these writeups are lacking some details and may be a bit unclear at some points since everything was written from memory.**

**There were four challenges we didn't solve in the WEB550 leg. We did get quite a way into solving several of these, but never managed to find the puzzle pieces that would have helped glue all our breadcrumbs together.**
